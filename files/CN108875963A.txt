Method, device, terminal device and storage medium for optimizing machine learning model
The invention relates to a method, a device, a terminal device and a storage medium for optimizing a machine learning model. The method comprises the following steps of: acquiring a plurality of datato be processed; inputting the data to be processed into the machine learning model, and filtering out the data to be processed as marking data according to a preset condition by using the machine learning model; training the machine learning model by using the training data to determine a trained model; and updating the machine learning model based on at least the trained model and the verification data; wherein the marking data includes training data and verification data. According to the method, the device, the terminal device and the storage medium for optimizing the machine learning model, the model can automatically iterate and converge, which greatly saves manpower and physical resource in the process of model optimization.
