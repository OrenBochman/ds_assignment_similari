Method for optimizing word classification in machine learning text
The invention relates to the field of data processing and machine learning classification, in particular to a method for optimizing word classification in machine learning text. The method comprises the steps that on the basis of text classification, self-defined and semantically related features are filtered out through a feature selection regulator based on a regular expression, a user customizes classification types in training data after feature selection, and classification based training is conducted by means of the features and the types according to a naive Bayesian model; after training is completed, in the application stage, if statements conforming to the feature selection regulator exist in text needing word classification, classification is completed by combining a trained model. According to the method, the capacity of the model for processing work classification is not limited in word data in a training sample; the method can be applied to optimization and application of machine learning text work classification and derivation functions thereof.
