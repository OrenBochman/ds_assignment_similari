Circuit configuration optimization device and machine learning device
The invention provides a circuit configuration optimization device and a machine learning device. The circuit configuration optimization device is provided with a machine learning device for learning a circuit configuration of an FPGA device, wherein the machine learning device observes circuit configuration data of the FPGA device and FPGA error occurrence state data indicating an error occurrence state of the FPGA device as state variables indicating a current state of an environment, and acquires determination data indicating a result of determination as to whether the FPGA device is in an operating state. Then, the circuit configuration of the FPGA device is learned in association with the FPGA error occurrence state data using these state variables and the determination data.
