AUTOMATED MACHINE LEARNING TAGGING AND OPTIMIZATION OF REVIEW PROCEDURES
Techniques for machine learning optimization are provided. A video comprising a plurality of segments is received, and a first segment of the plurality of segments is processed with a machine learning (ML) model to generate a plurality of tags, where each of the plurality of tags indicates presence of an element in the first segment. A respective accuracy value is determined for each respective tag of the plurality of tags, where the respective accuracy value is based at least in part on a maturity score for the ML model. The first segment is classified as accurate, based on determining that an aggregate accuracy of tags corresponding to the first segment exceeds a predefined threshold. Upon classifying the first segment as accurate, the first segment is bypassed during a review process.
