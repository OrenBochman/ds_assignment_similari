Optimal and efficient machine learning method for deep semantic segmentation
Four computerized machine learning methods for deep semantic segmentation are fast machine learning method, active machine learning method, optimal machine learning method, and optimal transfer learning method. The fast machine learning method performs a fast deep semantic segmentation learning on training images to generate a deep model. The active machine learning method performs a fast deep semantic segmentation learning on initial training images to generate a first deep model and then an active deep semantic segmentation learning to generate a second deep model. The optimal machine learning method performs a fast deep semantic segmentation learning on initial training images to generate a first deep model and then an optimal deep semantic segmentation learning to generate a second deep model. The optimal transfer learning method applies a pre-trained first deep model on transfer training images and then an optimal deep semantic segmentation transfer learning to generate a second deep model.
