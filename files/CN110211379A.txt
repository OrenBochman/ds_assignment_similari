Public transport scheduling optimization method based on machine learning
The invention discloses a public transport scheduling optimization method based on machine learning. Firstly, according to historical data, a machine learning method is adopted to establish a proxy model; then, an initial solution is generated, and a proxy model is used for predicting the initial solution; a scheme is preferably reserved according to an optimization objective, afterwards, the reserved optimal solution is sampled, the proxy model is used for predicating the optimal solution, and optimization of the scheduling scheme is achieved according to an optimization objective and an evaluation result. According to the method, public transport scheduling can be automatically optimized, so that certain assistance is provided for the scheduling of public transport, and more convenienceis provided for the travel of citizens.
