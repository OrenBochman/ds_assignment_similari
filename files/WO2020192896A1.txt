APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION OF A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL IN A FEDERATED LEARNING SYSTEM
A Federated learning server is configured to aggregate a plurality of received model updates to update a master machine learning model. Once a pre-defined threshold or interval for received model updates is reached a set of current hyper-parameter values and corresponding validation set performance metrics obtained from the updated master machine learning model are sent to a hyper-parameter optimization model. The optimization model infers the next set of optimal hyper-parameters using pairwise history of hyper-parameter values and the corresponding performance metrics. The inferred hyper-parameter values are sent to the Federated Learning server which updates the master machine learning model with the updated set of hyper-parameter values and redistributes the updated master machine learning model with the updated set of hyper-parameter values. The aspects of the disclosed embodiments provide for hyper-parameter optimization in a Federated learning mode to provide accurate personalized recommendations, for applications such as the Huawei video service.
