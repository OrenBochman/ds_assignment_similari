METHODS, SYSTEMS, ARTICLES OF MANUFACTURE, AND APPARATUS TO OPTIMIZE LAYERS OF A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FOR A TARGET HARDWARE PLATFORM
Methods, apparatus, systems, and articles of manufacture are disclosed that optimize layers of a machine learning model for a target hardware platform. An example apparatus includes a communication processor to obtain information specific to the target hardware platform (THP) on which to execute the machine learning model; a layer generation controller to generate layers of the machine learning model based on the information specific to the THP; and a deployment controller to, in response to the machine learning model satisfying a threshold error metric, deploy the machine learning model to the THP.
