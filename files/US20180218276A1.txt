Optimizing Application Performance Using Finite State Machine Model and Machine Learning
Aspects of the disclosure relate to optimizing application performance using a finite state model and machine learning. A computing platform may receive, via the communication interface, from a first user device, a web page request comprising task identification information. The computing platform may identify a task associated with the task identification information. The computing platform may receive, via the communication interface, from a machine learning server, a current transition cost associated with the task. The computing platform may select at least one optimization pattern used to optimize the current transition cost. The computing platform may generate one or more commands directing the machine learning server to execute the optimization pattern. The computing platform may send, via the communication interface, to the machine learning server, the one or more commands directing the machine learning server to execute the optimization pattern. The computing platform may calculate an updated current transition cost.
