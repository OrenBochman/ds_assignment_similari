MACHINE LEARNING OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK
Techniques that facilitate machine learning optimization are provided. In one example, a system includes a computational resource component, a batch interval component, and a machine learning component. The computational resource component collects computational resource data associated with a group of computing devices that performs a machine learning process. The batch interval component determines, based on the computational resource data, batch interval data indicative of a time interval to collect data for the machine learning process. The machine learning component provides the batch interval data to the group of computing devices to facilitate execution of the machine learning process based on the batch interval data.
