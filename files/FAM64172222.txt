SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR OBTAINING OPTIMAL MOTHER WAVELETS FOR FACILITATING MACHINE LEARNING TASKS 5 Systems and methods for obtaining optimal mother wavelets for facilitating machine learning tasks. The traditional systems and methods provide for selecting a mother wavelet and signal classification using some traditional techniques and methods but none them provide for selecting an optimal mother wavelet to facilitate machine learning tasks. Embodiments of the present disclosure provide for obtaining an optimal mother wavelet to facilitate machine learning tasks by computing values of energy 3 and entropy based upon labelled datasets and a probable set of mother wavelets, computing values of centroids and standard deviations based upon the values of energy and entropy, computing a set of distance values and normalizing the set of distance values and obtaining the optimal mother wavelet based upon the set of distance values for performing a wavelet transform and further facilitating machine learning tasks by classifying or regressing, a new set of signal classes, corresponding to a new 5 set of signals. Identifying by one or more hardware processors, a first set of signal data, based upon a plurality of signals, wherein the first set of signal data comprises labelled datasets corresponding to one or more signal classes 201 Computing based upon the first set of signal data and a probable set of mother wavelets, values of energy and entropy comprising of an entropy ratio and multilevel wavelet entropy of the first set of signals corresponding to a wavelet transform by the probable set of mother 202 wavelets Computing based upon the values of energy and entropy, a second set of signal data comprising values of centroids and standard deviations of the first set of signals corresponding to the one or more signal classes 203 Computing based upon the second set of signal data, a set of distance values comprising distance between the centroids corresponding to the one or more signal classes, wherein the set of distance values are computed based 204 upon a function corresponding to the second set of signal data Obtaining the one or more optimal mother wavelets, for performing the wavelet transform of the first set of signals, based upon the set of distance values and the values of standard deviations corresponding to the one or more 205 signal classes
