Configurable Machine Learning Method Selection and Parameter Optimization System and Method
A system and method for selecting a machine learning method and optimizing the parameters that control its behavior including receiving data; determining, using one or more processors, a first candidate machine learning method; tuning, using one or more processors, one or more parameters of the first candidate machine learning method; determining, using one or more processors, that the first candidate machine learning method and a first parameter configuration for the first candidate machine learning method are the best based on a measure of fitness subsequent to satisfaction of a stop condition; and outputting, using one or more processors, the first candidate machine learning method and the first parameter configuration for the first candidate machine learning method.
