Method and Apparatus for Operating Optimal of Equipment based on Machine Learning Model
Disclosed are a method and a device for optimally operating equipment based on a machine learning model. The present embodiment provides a method and a device for optimally operating equipment based on a machine learning model which, in order to optimally operate equipment in a building, inputs output values measured from the equipment provided in the building, overcomes a critical point of a general simulation model, and proposes diagnosis of a current operation state and an optimal operation condition with respect to a building equipment system (especially, a freezer, power, etc.).
