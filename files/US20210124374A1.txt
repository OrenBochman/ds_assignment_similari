VESSEL STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM USING MACHINE LEARNING TO OPTIMIZE RESOURCE USAGE
A stability controller includes a machine learning engine that outputs stability settings to several on-board stability systems of a vessel based on various inputs. The machine learning engine is first trained based on human selections of stability system settings, and then, once suitably trained, the stability controller can be used to optimize the use and operation of the stability systems as conditions change, based on a quantity or stability quality that the vessel operator desires to optimize.
