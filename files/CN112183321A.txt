Machine learning model optimization method and device, computer equipment and storage medium
The invention relates to a machine learning model optimization method and device, computer equipment and a storage medium. The method comprises the following steps: acquiring at least two first pictures; when a machine learning model in a model library cannot identify the first picture, labeling the first picture according to an input labeling instruction to obtain a first label; training the machine learning model according to the first picture and the first label to obtain a target machine learning model; pre-labeling an acquired second picture based on the target machine learning model to obtain a second label; and when the second label passes the label verification, performing training optimization on the target machine learning model according to the second picture and the second label. By adopting the method, the machine learning model training efficiency can be improved.
