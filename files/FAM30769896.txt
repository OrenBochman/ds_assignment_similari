SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR TRAIN ROUTE OPTIMIZATION INCLUDING MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEM
A machine learning system (100) for train route optimization includes a machine learning module (120) in communication with an optimization module (110) and including instructions stored in a memory that when executed by a processor (82) cause the machine learning module (120) to receive a plurality of schedules for railroad vehicles travelling through a track network transmitted by the optimization module (110), prioritize the plurality of schedules by applying at least one business rule (140) to the plurality of schedules based on dynamically learned behavior, and provide a prioritized list of schedules.
