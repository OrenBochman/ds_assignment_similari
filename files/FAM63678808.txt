CIRCUIT CONFIGURATION OPTIMIZATION APPARATUS AND MACHINE LEARNING DEVICE
Provided are a circuit configuration optimization apparatus and a machine learning device capable of reducing the occurrence frequency of a malfunction based on one of the current position and the current time of a FPGA device. The circuit configuration optimization apparatus includes: a state data acquisition section that acquires at least one of a current position and current time of the FPGA device as state data; and a circuit configuration determination section that determines a circuit configuration of the FPGA device based on the state data acquired by the state data acquisition section, and outputs a command value for reconfiguring the determined circuit configuration on the FPGA device.
