MANUFACTURING OPTIMIZATION USING A MULTI-TENANT MACHINE LEARNING PLATFORM
Techniques for manufacturing optimization using a multi-tenant machine learning platform are disclosed. A method for manufacturing optimization includes: obtaining physical sensor data, by a manufacturing device associated with a tenant of a multi-tenant machine learning platform; determining, by a machine learning spoke system associated with the tenant, a machine learning parameter based on at least the physical sensor data; preventing exposure of the first physical sensor data of the first manufacturing device to any other tenant of the multi-tenant machine learning platform; transmitting the machine learning parameter from the machine learning spoke system to a machine learning hub system of the multi-tenant machine learning platform; and updating, by the machine learning hub system, a multi-tenant machine learning model based at least on the machine learning parameter.
