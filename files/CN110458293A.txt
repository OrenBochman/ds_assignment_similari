A kind of distributed ADMM machine learning method optimizing network delay
A kind of distributed ADMM machine learning method for optimizing network delay is claimed in the present invention.One convex optimization problem can resolve into many convex optimization problems of son, and every convex optimization problem of height can be solved by ADMM algorithm in corresponding child node.For the overall operation limited speed based on bridge node and the distributed ADMM algorithm of working node in the influence of network connection delays, the invention proposes a kind of distributed ADMM machine learning algorithms for optimizing network delay, i.e. before carrying out ADMM interative computation, consider the influence of network delay, the position and number for dynamically planning bridge node can overcome network characteristics influences caused by algorithm performance such as network delay, dynamic, topographic morphologies, bandwidth limitation, data distributionization storage to a great extent.
