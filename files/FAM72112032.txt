Compiling optimization method and device for machine learning model
The invention discloses a compiling optimization method and device for a machine learning model. The method comprises the following steps: operating a first machine learning model for multiple times to process a group of preheating data; obtaining the shapes of an input tensor and an output tensor of each operation in the first group of operations in the process of running the first machine learning model for multiple times, and comparing whether the shapes of the input tensor and the output tensor of each operation in the first group of operations in the process of running the first machine learning model for multiple times are changed; determining the operation that the shapes of the input tensor and the output tensor are not changed in the process of operating the first machine learningmodel for multiple times as stable operation; dividing the plurality of stable operations into one or more compiling areas under the condition that the first group of operations comprises the plurality of stable operations; and combining the stable operations on the target compiling area in the first machine learning model through the target compiler to obtain a second machine learning model.
