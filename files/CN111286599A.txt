Alloy heat treatment technology optimization method based on machine learning
The invention discloses an alloy heat treatment technology optimization method based on machine learning, in order to quickly find an optimal heat treatment technology for alloy. The alloy heat treatment technology optimization method comprises the following steps that (1) an original training set is designed according to an orthogonal experiment, then, a technological parameter space is refined through an interpolation method, and an alloy technological parameter virtual space is built; (2) machine learning models based on alloy technology descriptors and target performance are built, and theoptimal suitable model is selected according to the performance evaluation; (3) the target performance of an alloy virtual space is forecasted by adopting a trained model; (4) a feedback experiment technology of the next time is subjected to balance development and exploration selecting through a global optimization algorithm; and (5) if the selected technology testing performance meets requirements of people, operation is stopped, and if not, the feedback loop continues being carried out till the requirements are met. The method for quickly optimizing the alloy heat treatment technology based on machine learning is high in iteration efficiency and can provide new solving ideas for alloy preparation, component optimization and technology exploration, the efficiency is improved, and the production cost is reduced.
