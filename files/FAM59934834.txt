Global optimization, searching and machine learning method based on Lamarck's principle of inheritance of acquired characters
The invention discloses a global optimization, searching and machine learning method based on a Lamarck's principle of inheritance of acquired characters. The global optimization, searching and machine learning method comprises the steps of: step 1, constructing an objective function f(x) according to a problem object; step 2, encoding the problem object into a chromosome of a genetic algorithm, automatically calculating or inputting operation parameters, and performing initialization; step 3, performing iterative optimization on a current (kth generation) population Gk
