OPTIMIZING A CELLULAR NETWORK USING MACHINE LEARNING
This document describes techniques and apparatuses for optimizing a cellular network using machine learning. In particular, a network-optimization controller (170) uses machine learning to determine an optimized network-configuration parameter (460) that affects a performance metric (410) of the cellular network. To make this determination, the network-optimization controller (170) requests and analyzes gradients (440) determined by one or more user equipments (UEs), one or more base stations, or combinations thereof. By using machine learning, the network-optimization controller (170) identifies different optimized network- configuration parameters (460) associated with different local optima or global optima of an optimization function, and selects a particular optimized network-configuration parameter (460) that is appropriate for a given environment. In this manner, the network-optimization controller (170) dynamically optimizes the cellular network to account for both short-term and long-term environmental changes.
