Test data optimization method and device of machine learning model and electronic equipment
The disclosure relates to a test data optimization method and device of a machine learning model, electronic equipment and a computer readable medium. The method comprises the following steps: acquiring test data, wherein the test data comprises a first score; determining a target scoring data set from a plurality of scoring data sets according to the first score for the test data, wherein the scoring data set comprises at least one piece of scoring data, and the scoring data comprises a second score; and updating the first score in the test data with the second score in the target score data set, wherein the updated test data is used for model testing of a machine learning model. The test data optimization method, the test data optimization device and the electronic equipment for the machine learning model can optimize the test data for the machine learning model, and the obtained test data is complete and accurate, so that the accuracy of the tested machine learning model is improved.
