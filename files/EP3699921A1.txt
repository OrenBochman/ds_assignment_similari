OPTIMIZING CATHETERIZATION LABORATORY THROUGHPUT USING MACHINE LEARNING
Systems and methods for determining one or more measures of interest for optimizing throughput of a catheterization laboratory are provided.A priorimedical procedure data relating to a medical procedure to be performed on a patient in a catheterization laboratory is received. One or more measures of interest are predicted based on the receiveda priorimedical procedure data using a trained machine learning model. The one or more measures of interest include an overall time for performing the medical procedure on the patient in the catheterization laboratory. The one or more predicted measures of interest are output.
