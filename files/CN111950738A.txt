Machine learning model optimization effect evaluation method and device, terminal and storage medium
The invention relates to the technical field of artificial intelligence, and provides a machine learning model optimization effect evaluation method and device, a terminal and a storage medium, and the method comprises the steps: segmenting a historical sample data set into a plurality of test sample data sets; predicting the plurality of test sample data sets by using a plurality of machine learning models to obtain a plurality of prediction values; constructing an evaluation function based on the business indexes and the technical indexes, and calculating a plurality of evaluation scores according to the plurality of prediction values and the evaluation function; constructing an evaluation matrix based on the plurality of evaluation scores; and evaluating an optimization effect value ofeach machine learning model according to a preset optimization effect evaluation model and the evaluation matrix. Each machine learning model subjected to multi-iteration optimization can be evaluatedby combining the business indexes and the technical indexes.
