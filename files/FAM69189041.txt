MACHINE LEARNING BASED SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR CREATING AN OPTIMAL PREDICTION MODEL AND OBTAINING OPTIMAL PREDICTION RESULTS
A system and method for optimizing the creation of prediction models and the acquisition of prediction results based on mechanical learning. In a program for creating an optimized prediction model, a plurality of training materials entered by a user, and at least one machine learning algorithm selected, are received, and the received training materials are uniformly converted into a relay format. Perform automated eigenvalue screening and machine learning algorithm parameter optimization, and perform iterative prediction model optimization. Thereafter, a prediction model and corresponding accuracy evaluation data are output. In the program for obtaining prediction results, the information to be predicted is converted into a relay format, and an automated program performs iterative prediction to generate and output prediction results and accuracy evaluation data.
