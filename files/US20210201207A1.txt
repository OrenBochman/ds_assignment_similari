Hierarchy Optimization Method for Machine Learning
A method includes receiving a set of training data and selecting a first machine learning platform based on a first optimization function that metrics past machine learning platforms used for training on the set of training data. The method also includes selecting a first algorithm supported by the first machine learning platform based on a second optimization function that metrics past algorithms used for training on the set of training data. Further, the method includes determining one or more hyperparameters supported by the first algorithm based on a third optimization function that metrics past combinations of hyperparameters from the set of hyperparameters used for training on the set of training data. The method also includes training a machine learning model on the set of training data using the first machine learning platform, the first algorithm, and the one or more hyperparameters.
