GLOBAL DATA FLOW OPTIMIZATION FOR MACHINE LEARNING PROGRAMS
A method for global data flow optimization for machine learning (ML) programs. The method includes receiving, by a storage device, an initial plan for an ML program. A processor builds a nested global data flow graph representation using the initial plan. Operator directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are connected using crossblock operators according to inter-block data dependencies. The initial plan for the ML program is re-written resulting in an optimized plan for the ML program with respect to its global data flow properties. The re-writing includes re-writes of: configuration dataflow properties, operator selection and structural changes.
