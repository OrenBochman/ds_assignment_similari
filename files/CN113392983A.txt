The invention belongs to the field of big data machine learning, in particular relates to a hyper-parameter optimization optimizing system and method for automatic machine learning, and aims to solve the problem that the existing machine learning method is difficult to support data mode diversification and scale maximization to carry out hyper-parameter optimization. The invention comprises the following steps: constructing a hyper-parameter initial space according to the existing hyper-parameter data; defining a hyper-parameter self-adaptive selection strategy function according to a preset learning target task, and screening a candidate hyper-parameter set meeting the learning target task from a hyper-parameter initial space; traversing candidate hyper-parameter sets and combining the candidate hyper-parameter sets through a preset self-adaptive optimization reasoning algorithm, simultaneously generating a parameter fidelity density curve, and obtaining an optimal hyper-parameter according to the variation of the fidelity density curve; and migrating the optimal hyper-parameter to a hyper-parameter space of the newly added target task domain to complete the initial optimization of the hyper-parameter of the newly added target task domain. The invention solves the problems that the parameter optimization of big data machine learning consumes too many computing resources and the parameter sharing is difficult.
