Apparatus for optimizing a machine learning system
<?claim?> An apparatus configured to optimize a configuration of a system for machine learning according to a cost function, a cost function identifying an architecture of the machine learning system, and hyperparameters parameterizing a training procedure, wherein the cost function measures a performance of the machine learning system, configured according to the parameters and trained by the training method, the apparatus comprising a machine-readable storage medium having stored thereon instructions that, when executed by a computer, cause the computer to perform a method comprising the steps of: a) providing a budget b; b) initializing a first predetermined number of individual configurations (pops), wherein each single configuration (pops) comprises a possible set of values of the parameters; c) determining the performance of the machine learning systems which are dependent on the parameters of each individual configuration (pops) constructed and trained by the training method parameterized by the hyperparameters of each individual configuration on the training data according to the cost function; d) starting an evolutionary search, comprising: i. generating progeny configurations of the individual configurations by a Mutation of the individual configurations; ii. selecting a plurality of the progeny configurations by crossover, III. Determining the performance of the machine learning systems constructed in dependence on the parameters of each selected progeny configuration and determined by the training method, parameterized by the hyperparameters of each selected progeny configuration, on which training data is trained according to the cost function, iv. selecting most powerful progeny configurations and replacing some of the individual configurations (pops) by the most powerful progeny configurations; and V. discarding a second predetermined number of single powerful configurations (pops); e) reconfiguring comprising decreasing the number of individual configurations by a third predetermined number and increasing the budget b by a predetermined amount; f) repeating a sequence, and d) "evolutionary search" and e) "reconfigure" until a predefined maximum Budget is reached; and g) returning one of the single configurations (pops) as an optimal configuration.
