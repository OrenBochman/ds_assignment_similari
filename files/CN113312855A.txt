Search space decomposition-based machine learning optimization method, electronic device, and medium
The invention relates to a machine learning optimization method based on search space decomposition, electronic equipment and a medium, wherein the method comprises the following steps: the construction module abstraction is used for fixing the value of partial hyper-parameters in the search space and optimizing the residual hyper-parameters in the search space so as to minimize the evaluation index and solve the subspace optimization problem; wherein the instances of the building block abstraction include a union block, a condition block, and an alternation block according to fixed different hyper-parameters. According to the invention, by using the construction module abstraction and the three instances of construction module abstraction, a huge space can be divided into a plurality of subspaces, the problem is converted into each optimization iteration selection to-be-optimized subspace by using the construction module abstraction, and the configuration is selected in a relatively small subspace, so that the search efficiency of machine learning configuration is improved.
