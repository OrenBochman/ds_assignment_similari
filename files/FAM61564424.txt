Machine learning device and machine learning method for learning optimal article holding path
The invention provides a machine learning device and a machine learning method for learning an optimal article holding path. The machine learning device of the present invention learns operation conditions of a robot for storing a plurality of articles arranged on a conveyor in a container using a hand which grips the plurality of articles, and includes: a state observation unit that observes, during operation of the robot, position and orientation of the plurality of articles, and a state variable including at least one of a cycle time until the plurality of articles are stored in the container, and a torque and a vibration generated when the robot grips the articles; a determination data acquisition unit that acquires determination data for determining the remaining amounts of the cycle time, the torque, and the vibration with respect to the allowable values; and a learning unit that learns the operating conditions of the robot in accordance with a training data set configured by a combination of the state variables and the determination data.
