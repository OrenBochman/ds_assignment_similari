Machine learning and statistical model based on the optimal configuration of the verification method optimizing workflow
The present invention discloses a machine learning and statistical model based on the optimal configuration and optimizing workflow of the verification method, comprising the steps of: generating a feasible RAI, obtaining workflow configuration for all possible combinations of example, all screened through the user's needs and to a satisfactory solution; feasible RAI featurizing, extracting features of the feature vectors to retrieve a resource allocation example, and uses the statistical model checking tool for carrying out successful; RAI predicted, using a machine learning method for the selected test set is trained regression function, and the predicted data of the test set for predicting results ranking; prediction result of verification, the predicted result to the statistical model checking tool, the success rate of the actual simulation values obtained, and eventually to approximate the optimal solution. The present invention is obtained in a short period of time the success rate of a highly reliable workflow resource allocation for example, improve the user experience.
