METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR MACHINE LEARNING MODEL HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION
This application relates to apparatus and methods for optimizing hyperparameters for machine learning models. In some examples, a computing device configures a machine learning model with a first set of hyperparameters from a pool of hyperparameters. The computing device may execute the machine learning model to generate a validation score, and may update parameters of a probability determination model based on the validation score. Further, the computing device may execute the probability determination model to generate probabilities corresponding to the first set of hyperparameters. The computing device may also determine a second set of hyperparameters from the pool of hyperparameters based on the generated probabilities, and may configure the machine learning model with the second set of hyperparameters. The computing device may repeat the process of generating validation scores, updating the parameters, and generating probabilities to determine sets of hyperparameters until at least one condition is satisfied.
