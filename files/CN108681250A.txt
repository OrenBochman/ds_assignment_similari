Improved machine learning fault diagnosis system based on swarm intelligence optimization
The invention discloses an improved machine learning fault diagnosis system based on swarm intelligence optimization, which is used for fault diagnosis of the ethylene cracking process. The system comprises a data preprocessing module, a principal component analysis module, a weighted least squares support vector machine module and a swarm intelligence algorithm module. The system performs the fault diagnosis and prediction of the important parameter indexes of the ethylene cracking chemical process, overcomes the shortage of the existing chemical fault diagnosis technology that is low in instrument prediction precision and is susceptible to human factors, increases the robustness of the fault diagnosis system, introduces the swarm intelligence algorithm module to automatically optimize the weighted least squares support vector machine parameters, and does not require human experience or multiple tests to adjust the model parameters, thereby obtaining an improved machine learning faultdiagnosis system with the optimal swarm intelligence optimization. The system improves the prediction robustness of the fault diagnosis system, and has better effects especially when there is a singular point in the system data or the conventional Gaussian distribution is not satisfied.
