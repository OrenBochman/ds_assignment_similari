Optimizing manufacturing processes using one or more machine learning models
Manufacturing processes can be optimized using machine learning models. For example, a system can execute an optimization model to identify a recommended set of values for configurable settings of a manufacturing process associated with an object. The optimization model can determine the recommended set of values by implementing an iterative process using an objective function. Each iteration of the iterative process can include selecting a current set of candidate values for the configurable settings from within a current region of a search space defined by the optimization model; providing the current set of candidate values as input to a trained machine learning model that can predict a value for a target characteristic of the object or the manufacturing process based on the current set of candidate values; and identifying a next region of the search space to use in a next iteration of the iterative process based on the value.
