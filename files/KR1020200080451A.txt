Machine learning based livestock optimal energy management system and its method
The present invention relates to a machine learning based livestock house energy management system. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system which monitors energy generated in a livestock house by using machine learning and saves energy used in the livestock house. By using the system, optimal energy can be managed anytime and anywhere in real time by analyzing information on a surrounding environment and energy consumption and energy costs (power bills) can be reduced by providing power usage guidelines for a smart livestock house.
