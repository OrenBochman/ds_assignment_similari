Method for optimizing hyper-parameters of machine learning model
The invention discloses a method for optimizing hyper-parameters of a machine learning model, and relates to a method for optimizing hyper-parameters. The objective of the invention is to solve the problems of low accuracy, low efficiency and high cost of an existing hyper-parameter optimization tuning method. The method comprises the following steps: 1, constructing known experience information;randomly selecting N/2 hyper-parameter configurations from the lambda PN for evaluation, and storing evaluation information into ExpInfo; 2, converting the known experience information into a classification data set; 3, selecting a key hyper-parameter from all hyper-parameters; 4, utilizing KeyPars to speculate the optimal hyper-parameter configuration of the Num group; 5, evaluating hyper-parameter configuration in ExpNew, and updating known experience information; and 6, repeatedly executing the steps 2-5 times, and finally outputting the optimal hyper-parameter configuration in the known experience information and recommending the optimal hyper-parameter configuration to the user. The method is applied to the field of hyper-parameter tuning.
