Cloud edge cooperation-based throughput optimization machine learning inference task deployment method
The invention discloses a machine learning inference task deployment method based on cloud edge cooperation throughput optimization, which comprises the following steps: the method comprises the steps of establishing a machine learning inference task deployment model under a cloud edge collaborative scene, calculating time delay of a current stage and data transmission time delay between the stages, further establishing an inference task deployment optimization problem with optimized throughput, and designing an efficient deployment strategy based on a dynamic planning idea to obtain an optimal deployment scheme. The method is based on a cloud edge cooperation scene, the inference task is divided into serial stages, and the pipeline is adopted to process the inference task in parallel, so that the throughput of the inference task is optimized.
