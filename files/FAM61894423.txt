DNA methylation prediction method for selecting optimal feature based on machine learning
The invention discloses a DNA methylation prediction method for selecting optimal feature based on machine learning. The DNA methylation prediction method disclosed by the invention comprises the following steps: firstly different number of most relevant CpG loci are searched by using different machine learning algorithms I, a most relevant CpG locus set of different models is constructed, then the most relevant CpG locus set of different models is tested by utilizing different machine learning algorithms II, a test result is compared with a result of a real experiment, and number of the mostrelevant CpG loci used by an optimal model and a machine learning algorithm type are determined according to evaluation indexes, so that establishment of a prediction model based on multiple most relevant CpG loci is completed. The DNA methylation prediction method increases search efficiency of the most relevant CpG loci, so that prediction performance of the prediction model is improved.
