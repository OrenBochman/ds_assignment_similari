MODEL INSIGHTS FRAMEWORK FOR PROVIDING INSIGHT BASED ON MODEL EVALUATIONS TO OPTIMIZE MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
Methods and systems are provided for evaluating providing insight into complex machine learning models to facilitate optimization of the models at scale. In particular, a system can guide and/or implement model training and evaluation in various machine learning environments. Further, the system is capable of using standardized evaluation metrics to provide insight into the success of iterations of a machine learning model. Additionally, the system allows for presenting visualizations based on such evaluation metrics to facilitate gaining insight into one or more machine learning models and/or instances of a machine learning model.
