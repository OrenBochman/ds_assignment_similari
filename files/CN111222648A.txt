Semi-supervised machine learning optimization method, device and equipment and storage medium
The invention discloses a semi-supervised machine learning optimization method, device and equipment and a storage medium, and the method comprises the steps: obtaining a training sample which comprises a labeled sample and an unlabeled sample; performing calculating to obtain a pseudo label corresponding to the training sample according to the similarity between the training sample and the labeled sample and the real label of the labeled sample; inputting the data of the training sample into an initialization machine learning model to obtain a first prediction label corresponding to the training sample, and calculating a loss function of the initialization machine learning model according to the first prediction label and the pseudo label; performing parameter updating on the initialization machine learning model based on the loss function, and performing iterative training until the loss function converges to obtain a target machine learning model. According to the method, a model with a good effect can be obtained through training by adopting a small amount of labeled data, and manpower and material resources for manually labeling the data are saved.
