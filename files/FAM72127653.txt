Compiling optimization method and device of machine learning model
The invention discloses a compiling optimization method and device of a machine learning model. Wherein, the method comprises the following steps: the first machine learning model is operated for multiple times to process a group of preheating data, and model operation information in the processing process is collected; according to the model running information, determining an operation with unchanged tensor shape in the first group of operations as a target operation; and under the condition that the target operation comprises a plurality of operations in the first group of operations, merging the target operation in the first machine learning model through the target compiler to obtain a second machine learning model. The invention solves the technical problems of long compiling period and resource waste caused by no introduction of sampling information during running in the compiling process of machine learning.
