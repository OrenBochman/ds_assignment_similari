Machine learning optimization method and device
The invention discloses a machine learning optimization method and device in the field of artificial intelligence, and is used for optimizing a machine learning model to obtain a machine learning model with better robustness. The method comprises: obtaining a machine learning model, and performing at least one iterative update on the machine learning model through a preset data set to obtain an updated machine learning model meeting a preset condition. Any iterative updating comprises: obtaining a plurality of loss values corresponding to a plurality of tasks executed by the machine learning model after the last iterative updating, selecting at least one loss value greater than the average loss value from the plurality of loss values, updating the machine learning model after the last iterative update according to at least one loss value greater than the average loss value and the task corresponding to each loss value in the at least one loss value, and if the currently updated machinelearning model does not meet the preset condition, performing next iterative updating on the currently updated machine learning model.
