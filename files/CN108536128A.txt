Parameter-optimized machine learning fault diagnosis system
The invention discloses a parameter-optimized machine learning fault diagnosis system. The system is used for fault diagnosis of the ethylene cracking process and comprises a data preprocessing module, a principal component analysis module, a machine learning module and a swarm Intelligence algorithm module. Fault diagnosis is performed on important parameter indexes in the chemical process of ethylene cracking, the defects that existing chemical fault diagnosis technologies are low in instrument prediction accuracy and are easily affected by human factors are overcome, the swarm Intelligencealgorithm module is introduced to optimize parameters of a support vector machine, so that the parameter-optimized machine learning fault diagnosis system is obtained. The system has good prediction effect under the condition of small samples and easily finds the global optimal solution.
